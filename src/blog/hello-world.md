## Why Technology Matters in Healthcare
> "The art of medicine consists of amusing the patient while nature cures the disease. Technology helps us reach those patients, wherever they are." — Adapted from Voltaire

> "Access to information is access to care. Digital health bridges the gap for millions who cannot reach a clinic." — Dr. A. Mensah

> "In rural Africa, a mobile phone can be the difference between isolation and lifesaving advice." — Community Health Advocate
