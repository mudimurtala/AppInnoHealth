# The Importance of Breastfeeding: Nourishing the Future

## Introduction

Breastfeeding is one of the most effective ways to ensure child health and survival. The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life, followed by continued breastfeeding along with appropriate complementary foods for up to two years or beyond. Yet, many families and communities are unaware of the profound benefits breastfeeding brings to both children and mothers.
