# The Importance of Exercise: Health Benefits and Risks of Inactivity

Physical activity is a cornerstone of good health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), "physical activity is any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure." Regular exercise is essential for maintaining physical and mental well-being, yet many people do not get enough activity in their daily lives.

## Defining Exercise and Physical Activity

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines exercise as "planned, structured, and repetitive bodily movement done to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness." Physical activity includes all movement, not just exercise—such as walking, gardening, or household chores.

## The Health Benefits of Regular Exercise

- **Reduces risk of chronic diseases:** Regular exercise lowers the risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers.
- **Improves mental health:** Physical activity reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety, and improves mood and cognitive function.
- **Strengthens muscles and bones:** Exercise helps build and maintain strong bones, muscles, and joints.
- **Supports weight management:** It helps control body weight and reduces the risk of obesity.
- **Boosts immune function:** Regular activity enhances the immune system and helps fight off illness.
- **Promotes better sleep:** Exercise can improve sleep quality and duration.

## The Dangers of Physical Inactivity

The WHO warns that physical inactivity is one of the leading risk factors for global mortality. Lack of exercise can lead to:

- **Increased risk of chronic diseases**
- **Obesity and weight gain**
- **Poor mental health and increased stress**
- **Weaker muscles and bones**
- **Reduced quality of life and independence**

> "Those who think they have not time for bodily exercise will sooner or later have to find time for illness."
> — Edward Stanley, Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom

## How Much Exercise Do We Need?

The WHO recommends:
- **Adults:** At least 150–300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, plus muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days per week.
- **Children and adolescents:** At least 60 minutes per day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.
